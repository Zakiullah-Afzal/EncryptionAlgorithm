This is a simple encryption algorithm for practice, based on a mathematical concept. For example, if we take the character "a," it is first converted to its ASCII code (97), and then the digits are reversed to get 79.  | 97-79=18  n = (sqrt(79)*PI - sqrt(18)*PI)
m = (sqrt(79)*PI + sqrt(18)*PI for decryption m = (m-n) / 2 | a = m+n | (m/PI)^2 (a/PI)^2 | b = (a+m) rever(b)   
Note: For any number, such as 101, we simply calculate the square root of the number and then multiply it by PI.
